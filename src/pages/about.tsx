        Hello! My name is Nathaniel, but most people just call me Nate. I'm a
        college student majoring in Computer Science, and I created SimplyPi to
        share my passion for learning and teaching.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back in high school, I kept all my school notes digitally on Google
        Docs, I was never a fan of pen & paper for notes. Anytime I learned
        something new, I would update my notes, refining and expanding them over
        time. My friends started asking for my notes and it was real easy
        because they were just Google Docs, I could text them a copy of it. But
        then they'd often came to me for help with difficult subjects. That's
        when I realized how much I enjoyed breaking down complex topics and
        making them easier to understand. I did this throughout all of my high
        school years. By the time I got to college, I became a dedicated tutor
        in Math and Science working at a local tutoring workshop and on campus.
        Teaching and inspiring others quickly became a passion of mine. But
        rather than just sharing my notes with a few friends, I wanted to build
        something bigger, a free platform where anyone, anywhere, could access
        STEM resources without barriers. That's how SimplyPi was born, an online
        learning hub designed to make Math & Science as Simple as Pi; Hence the
        name.
        <br />
        <br />
        SimplyPi is an open-source, community-driven project that encourages
        students to help each other learn and grow. I believe the modern
        education system is flawed, especially in how it teaches Math. Too
        often, students are left feeling frustrated or discouraged. I want to
        change that. This platform is built with the belief that anyone can
        learn Math & Scienceâ€”they just need the right approach. SimplyPi is
        completely free, ensuring that students who can't afford expensive
        tutoring or resources still have access to clear, structured, and
        engaging educational materials.
        <br />
        <br />
        SimplyPi isn't just my project, it's a vision. This website is open-source,
        and I welcome contributions from fellow learners, educators, and
        developers who share the vision of making STEM education accessible to
        everyone. This is <i>for students, by students</i>. I don't know everything and I encourage those to help add on to this vision. Whether you're here to learn, teach, or contribute, you're
        part of something bigger, a movement to make learning simple, fun, and
        available to all.
