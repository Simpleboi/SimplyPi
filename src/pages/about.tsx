        Hello!üëãüèΩ My name is{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/Simpleboi" target="_blank">
          Nathaniel
        </a>
        , but most people just call me{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/Simpleboi" target="_blank">
          Nate
        </a>
        . I'm a college student majoring in Computer Science, and I created{" "}
        <span>SimplyPi</span> to share my passion for learning and teaching.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back in high school, I kept all my school notes digitally on Google
        Docs. I was never a fan of pen & paper for notes, mainly because I could
        type faster than I could write. Anytime I learned something new, I would
        update my notes, refining and expanding them over time. My friends
        started asking for my notes and it was real easy to give it to them
        because they were just Google Docs, I could text them a copy of it. But
        then they'd often came to me for help with difficult subjects. That's
        when I realized how much I enjoyed breaking down complex topics and
        making them easier to understand. I did this throughout all of my high
        school years. By the time I got to college, I became a dedicated tutor
        in Math and Science working at a local tutoring workshop and on campus,
        I also became the President of the Computer Science Club at my campus.
        Teaching and inspiring others quickly became a passion of mine. But
        rather than just sharing my notes with a few friends, I wanted to build
        something bigger, a free platform where anyone, anywhere, could access
        STEM resources without barriers. That's how <span>SimplyPi</span> was
        born, an online learning hub designed to make Math & Science as{" "}
        <span>Simple</span> as <span>Pi</span>; Hence the name.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>SimplyPi</span> is an open-source, community-driven project that
        encourages students to help each other learn and grow. I believe the
        modern education system is flawed, especially in how it teaches Math.
        Too often, students are left feeling frustrated or discouraged. I want
        to change that. This platform is built with the belief that anyone can
        learn Math & Science, they just need the right approach.{" "}
        <span>SimplyPi</span> is completely free, ensuring that students who
        can't afford expensive tutoring or resources still have access to clear,
        structured, and engaging educational materials.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>SimplyPi</span> isn't just my personal project, it's a vision.
        This platform is open-source, and I welcome contributions from fellow
        learners, educators, and developers who share the idea of making STEM
        education accessible to everyone. This is{" "}
        <i>for students, by students</i>. I don't know everything and I
        encourage those to help add on to this vision. Whether you're here to
        learn, teach, or contribute, you're part of something bigger, a movement
        to make learning simple, fun, and available to all.
